Solar
=====

Description
-----------
We will write a solar system where the bodies follows a subset of the laws of 
physics. The player can move around in the system and configure the initial
state of the system.

Will Do
-------
        * Bodies with physical properties
        * Newtonian physics
        * Configurable initial state
        * Collision handling
        * Movable camera
        * Light source(s)
        * Spacebox (skybox but in SPACE!)


Might Do
--------
        * Random initial state
        * Relativistic physics (special)
        * Drawing optimized for frustum
        * No sound (because SPACE!)
        * Landing on selected bodies (sound?)
        * Asteroid belt
        * Build our solar system
        * Trans-Neptunian objects (Pluto?, Deathstar?)
        * Aliens
